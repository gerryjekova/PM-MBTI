Subject: Quick update on our communication process

Hi [Client Name],

I hope this message finds you well! I've enjoyed working together on [project] and want to ensure we maintain our productive relationship.

I wanted to touch base about our communication process to make sure it continues to work well for both of us.

As a reminder, for [specific boundary being crossed, e.g., "requests outside our agreed scope" or "communications outside business hours"]:

• My standard process is to [restate your boundary, e.g., "document these through our change request process" or "respond during business hours (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm ET)"]

• This helps me [explain benefit to them, e.g., "ensure I deliver the highest quality work on your priority items" or "maintain focused time to complete your deliverables on schedule"]

Moving forward, the best way to [handle the situation] would be to [specific action you want them to take].

For urgent matters that truly can't wait, please [your emergency protocol].

Is this process clear and workable for you? If you have any concerns or special circumstances, I'm happy to discuss alternatives that could work for both of us.

Thank you for your understanding. I'm committed to delivering excellent results for [their company/project], and maintaining clear communication helps me do my best work for you.

## "Why Behind the What" Question Framework

Use these questions to uncover clients' underlying goals behind specific requests.

```
REQUEST CLARIFICATION FRAMEWORK

When a client makes a specific request, use these questions to understand the deeper objectives:

FIRST-LEVEL QUESTIONS (Start here):
• "What's the main goal you're hoping to achieve with this [specific request]?"
• "How do you envision this [specific element] contributing to the project's success?"
• "What problem are you trying to solve with this approach?"
• "Could you help me understand the context behind this request?"

SECOND-LEVEL QUESTIONS (Dig deeper):
• "Who is the primary audience for this [feature/element/content], and what action do you want them to take?"
• "How will you measure whether this is successful once implemented?"
• "Have you tried other approaches to address this need before? What happened?"
• "What would be the impact if we didn't include this specific element?"

ALTERNATIVE EXPLORATION:
• "Would you be open to considering alternative approaches that might achieve the same goal?"
• "Based on what you've shared, I might recommend [alternative]. Would that address your underlying need?"
• "I've worked on similar challenges before, and found that [alternative approach] was effective because [reason]. Would that be worth exploring here?"

ALIGNMENT CONFIRMATION:
• "So if I understand correctly, your main objective is [restated goal], and you've suggested [their request] as a way to achieve that. Is that accurate?"
• "Would it be fair to say that the success metric for this element would be [proposed metric]?"
• "If we achieve [stated underlying goal], but through a different approach than originally discussed, would that meet your needs?"
```

STEP 3: CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS (For unclear feedback)
Questions to ask the client:
• "Could you help me understand more specifically what aspect of [element] isn't working for you?"
• "When you say [quote vague feedback], could you elaborate on what you'd prefer to see instead?"
• "Would you be able to share an example of what you're envisioning?"
• "On a scale of 1-10, how important is this change compared to other revisions?"
