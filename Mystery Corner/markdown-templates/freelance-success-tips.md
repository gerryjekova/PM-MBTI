# Freelance Success Tips & Best Practices

## Client Relationship Management

### Setting Expectations from Day One

The most successful freelance relationships begin with crystal-clear expectations. Implement these practices for every new client:

1. **Comprehensive onboarding document** - Create a "Working Together Guide" that outlines:
   - Your working hours and typical response times
   - Preferred communication methods and emergency protocols
   - How to submit feedback (format, process, timelines)
   - What constitutes a "revision" vs. a "new request"
   - Your process for scope changes and additional work

2. **Kickoff call best practices**
   - Schedule for 30-45 minutes (not shorter)
   - Send agenda beforehand with specific points to cover
   - Record the call (with permission) for reference
   - Follow up with written summary of decisions and action items
   - Establish next check-in time before concluding call

3. **Boundary maintenance tactics**
   - Set up auto-responders for off-hours with clear expectations
   - Create templates for common boundary reset situations
   - Schedule "office hours" for real-time client communication
   - Train clients to batch non-urgent requests

### Client Communication Psychology

Understanding the psychology behind client communications helps you navigate challenging situations with professionalism:

1. **The "Why Behind the What"**
   - When clients make specific requests, uncover their underlying goals
   - Ask "What would that accomplish for you?" to understand true needs
   - Reframe solutions around core objectives rather than specific methods

2. **Managing feedback constructively**
   - Acknowledge emotional responses privately before responding
   - Ask clarifying questions to make vague feedback actionable
   - Restate criticism as problems to solve together
   - Present alternative solutions rather than just rejections

3. **Creating client advocates**
   - Find opportunities to make clients look good to their stakeholders
   - Provide talking points they can use to explain work to others
   - Give advance notice of potential issues or delays
   - Remember and reference personal details appropriately

### Strategic Pricing Psychology

Pricing effectively is about psychology as much as economics:
