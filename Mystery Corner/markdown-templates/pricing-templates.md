# Freelance Pricing Templates & Strategies

## 1. Service Pricing Table Template

Create a clear, professional pricing table that showcases your value tiers:

| Service Tier | Basic | Standard | Premium |
|--------------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Price** | $XXX | $XXX | $XXX |
| **Turnaround Time** | 7 days | 5 days | 3 days |
| **Revisions** | 1 | 2 | Unlimited |
| **Feature 1** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Feature 2** | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Feature 3** | - | - | ✓ |
| **Feature 4** | - | - | ✓ |
| **Bonus** | - | - | ✓ |

**Pro Tip:** Always include 3 tiers - most clients select the middle option when presented with three choices.

## 2. Value-Based Pricing Calculator

Use this formula to calculate project rates based on client value rather than just your time:

```
Project Fee = Base Rate + (Client's Potential ROI × Value Factor)
```

Where:
- Base Rate = Your minimum acceptable project fee
- Client's Potential ROI = Estimated financial benefit to client
- Value Factor = Percentage of value you capture (typically 10-20%)

**Example:** 
- Base Rate: $2,000
- Client's annual revenue increase from project: $50,000
- Value Factor: 15%
- Project Fee = $2,000 + ($50,000 × 0.15) = $9,500

## 3. Hourly Rate Calculator

Formula for calculating your minimum viable hourly rate:

```
Hourly Rate = (Annual Living Expenses + Business Expenses + Tax Provision) ÷ Billable Hours
```

**Real-World Example:**
- Annual Living Expenses: $45,000
- Business Expenses: $10,000
- Tax Provision (30%): $16,500
- Billable Hours (25 hrs/week × 48 weeks): 1,200
- Minimum Hourly Rate = ($45,000 + $10,000 + $16,500) ÷ 1,200 = $59.58

## 4. Project Rate Multiplier Table

| Project Factor | Multiplier |
|----------------|------------|
| Tight deadline (rush job) | 1.5-2x |
| Difficult client (based on reviews/reputation) | 1.25-1.5x |
| Strategic importance (portfolio builder) | 0.8-1x |
| Intellectual property transfer | 1.2-1.5x |
| Weekend/holiday work | 1.5x |
| Specialized expertise required | 1.3-2x |

**Example Application:** $1,500 base project × 1.5 (rush job) × 1.3 (specialized knowledge) = $2,925
